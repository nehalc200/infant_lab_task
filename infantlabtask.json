Begin with a rectangular sheet of paper. Place flat on a table with the long edges on the left and the right. Fold the paper in half lengthwise to create a center crease.\n\nThen unfold it so the crease remains visible.\n\nNext, fold the top left corner inward so its edges aligns with the center crease, and repeat this with the top right corner to form a pointed tip. Then fold each of the new diagonal edges inward once more toward the center to sharpen the nose of the plane. After completing these folds, fold the entire sheet in half along the original center crease to form the wings.\n\nFold the top layer downward on one side so its edges aligns with the bottom edge of the plane. Then turn the plane over and repeat on the other side. Adjust the wings so they are even and angled slightly upward. The airplane is now complete and ready. Thank you.","originalContent":"Here is how to build a paper airplane. Begin with a rectangular sheet of paper. Place flat on a table with the long edges on the left and the right.
